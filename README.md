# Optimizing-join-queries-using-Reinforcement-Learning
Tackling the problem of join ordering using Deep Reinforcement learning.

This project is based on the [S.Krishnan et.al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03196), where the authors showed the potential of using Deep Reinforcement Learning for solving join ordering problem lead to great results.
We aim to implement and improve upon this work.Final goal is to integrate this technique into the present day query optimizers used in MySQl,PostgreSQL,Apache Spark etc.
